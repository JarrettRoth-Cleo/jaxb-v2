### Clarify changes

Clarify needed changes to various aspects of the XJC parsing/generation process.  Most notably:

* Standard NameConverter needs to preserve how items are represented in the XSD
* ObjectFactory needs to honor bindings values for fields/classes
* ComplexType restriction needs to be enabled

#### Add generated code to Clarify

To add all necessary classes to the XSD import wizard, you must build the project to generate the XJC deliverables.  Then, you will need to generate the dependencies for the project's runtime.

*Note*: this process is multipart and generates more jars than there were before, but I am not sure how the XJC team generates the smaller jar that just contains XSD and DTD dependencies.

Generating the project's deliverables:

1. cd jaxb-ri
2. mvn package

This will run all tests and generate deliverables for each module.

Generating XJC dependencies:

1. cd jaxb-ri/xjc
2. mvn dependency:copy-dependencies -DincludeScope=runtime


After completing these 2 mvn calls, the XJC jar can be found in jaxb-ri/xjc/xjc/target and all dependencies can be found in jaxb-ri/xjc/xjc/target/dependencies.  All need to be added to the xsd.importwizard plugin.


### Overriding the Default NameConverter

Changes were made to the XJC logic to no longer utilize the hard coded NameConverter.standard NameConverter instance.  This allows us to change how the class/interface/field names are generated without having to rebuild the entire XJC project.

This [class](jaxb-v2/jaxb-ri/core/src/main/java/com/sun/xml/bind/api/impl/NameConverterProvider.java) was added to be the source of each kind of NameConverter instance available to the XJC project.  

This [test suite](jaxb-v2/jaxb-ri/xjc/src/test/java/xjcTests/NameConverterOverrideTest.java) was created to represent how the standard NameConverter can be implemented.

The current instance of the Standard NameConverter used in the test attempts to remove any automatic camel casing so it matches the XSD closer.  This doesn't follow Java naming conventions, but it does match the data closer.

TODO: Possibly, expose and override the `Standard#removeIllegalIdentifierChars` method in order to map Illegal Identifier characters to their full names.
Ex: '*' is found in an element name, replace it with 'asterisk'
