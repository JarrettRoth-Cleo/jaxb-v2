### Changes in Fork

#### NameConverter

The  [NameConverter](jaxb-ri/core/src/main/java/com/sun/xml/bind/api/impl/NameConverter.java) interface has all instances moved from out to the [NameConverterProvider](jaxb-ri/core/src/main/java/com/sun/xml/bind/api/impl/NameConverterProvider.java) class definition.  

Now, the interface is just an interface and can be changed via the SchemaCompiler's options.  All previous references to NameConverter.standard are now going through the NameConverterProvider.getStandard() static method.


#### JCodeModel is slighty more mutable

Changes throughout the JCodeModel classes were needed to be made so post processing could be done to the instances.  

Some changes:
* [JBlock](jaxb-ri/codemodel/codemodel/src/main/java/com/sun/codemodel/JBlock.java) content can be reset
* [JAssignment](jaxb-ri/codemodel/codemodel/src/main/java/com/sun/codemodel/JAssignment.java) exposes right hand side field
* [JAnnotationUse](jaxb-ri/codemodel/codemodel/src/main/java/com/sun/codemodel/JAnnotationUse.java) exposes itself and the class it models
* [JAnnotationStringValue](jaxb-ri/codemodel/codemodel/src/main/java/com/sun/codemodel/JAnnotationStringValue.java) is exposed along with its value
* [JAnnotationArrayMember](jaxb-ri/codemodel/codemodel/src/main/java/com/sun/codemodel/JAnnotationArrayMember.java) exposes the values
* [JExpressionDotClass](jaxb-ri/codemodel/codemodel/src/main/java/com/sun/codemodel/JExpressionDotClass.java) new class that is used in the [JExpr](jaxb-ri/codemodel/codemodel/src/main/java/com/sun/codemodel/JExpr.java) for classes found throughout the model.  This exposed itself to outside processes.
* [JInvocation](jaxb-ri/codemodel/codemodel/src/main/java/com/sun/codemodel/JInvocation.java) allows to view the type and change the type
* [JMods](jaxb-ri/codemodel/codemodel/src/main/java/com/sun/codemodel/JMods.java) is made public
* [JNarrowedClass](jaxb-ri/codemodel/codemodel/src/main/java/com/sun/codemodel/JNarrowedClass.java) is made public along with getter methods for its values
* [JStringLiteral](jaxb-ri/codemodel/codemodel/src/main/java/com/sun/codemodel/JStringLiteral.java) allows the str value to change through a setter method
* [JVar](jaxb-ri/codemodel/codemodel/src/main/java/com/sun/codemodel/JVar.java) enables setting annotations on itself and enables changing the mods

#### Ref instantiation is controlled through a factory

A new class [RefFactory](jaxb-ri/xjc/src/main/java/com/sun/tools/xjc/reader/xmlschema/ref/RefFactory.java) was added that can be overridden in the SchemaCompiler's options so change how reference classes are instantiated.

The current implementations where originally found in the [RawTypeSetBuilder](jaxb-ri/xjc/src/main/java/com/sun/tools/xjc/reader/xmlschema/RawTypeSetBuilder.java).  Classes that referenced RawTypeSetBuilder.Ref are now referencing the new [Ref](jaxb-ri/xjc/src/main/java/com/sun/tools/xjc/reader/xmlschema/ref/Ref.java) class.

An example of how to change the functionality of the RefFactory can be found in the [AbstractXJCTest](jaxb-ri/xjc/src/test/java/xjcTests/AbstractXJCTest.java)#addCustomTestingOptions method

#### CTBuilder instantiation is controlled through a factory

A new class [CTBuilderFactory](jaxb-ri/xjc/src/main/java/com/sun/tools/xjc/reader/xmlschema/ct/CTBuilderFactory.java) was added that can be overridden in the SchemaCompiler's options so change how complex type builders are instantiated.

The [CTBuilder](jaxb-ri/xjc/src/main/java/com/sun/tools/xjc/reader/xmlschema/ct/CTBuilder.java) has been updated to load its array of CTBuilders through the factory instead of an instance variable.

An example of how to change the functionality of the CTBuilderFactory can be found in the [AbstractXJCTest](jaxb-ri/xjc/src/test/java/xjcTests/AbstractXJCTest.java)#addCustomTestingOptions method
